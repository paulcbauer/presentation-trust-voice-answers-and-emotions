## Today's Agenda

<font size = "6">

- 1. [Audio Data in the Social Sciences and in Surveys]{style="color:blue"}: What insights can we gain by leveraging spoken responses in surveys to understand respondents' views more deeply?

- 2. [Emotion Analysis]{style="color:blue"}: What insights can we gain through automated emotion analysis of audio responses?

- 3. [Emotions in Political Trust]{style="color:blue"}: Can we use audio data and emotion analysis to measure political trust? Do emotions affect political trust
judgments?

## What is Audio Data?

::: header
Audio Data in the Social Sciences and in Surveys
:::

<font size = "6">

- Audio data = information represented in the form of sound waves captured in a digital format (e.g., WAV)

<figure>

<img src="waveform.png" width="1300" height="250"/>

<figcaption>Figure 1: Waveform of an audio file (amplitude over time).</figcaption>

</figure>


::: fragment
- Sources for audio data for the social sciences: Interviews, Social Media (e.g. live streams, Youtube), public speeches and debates, political talk shows and podcasts, press conferences, [recorded audio survey answers]{style="color:blue"}.
:::


</font size>


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are characteristics of Audio Data?

::: header
Audio Data in the Social Sciences and in Surveys
:::

<font size = "6">

- Audio Data contains rich information including paralinguistic elements
	- e.g., pitch, volume, laughter and sighs, tone of voice, pause and silence, emotional cues

::: fragment
Cognitive Processing Modes:
	
- "System 1" versus "System 2" language [(L√ºtters et al. 2018)]{style="color:blue"}
	- System 1: Intuitive, Automatic, and Fast Thinking ‚Üí Spoken language
	- System 2: Analytical, Deliberate, and Slow Thinking ‚Üí Written language
:::

</font size>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Audio Answers in Surveys

::: header
Audio Data in the Social Sciences and in Surveys
:::

<font size = "6">

- Spoken answers compared to written answers are longer, more elaborate and detailed [(Gavras et al. 2022, H√∂hne & Gavras 2022, L√ºtters et al. 2018, Revilla et al. 2020)]{style="color:blue"}
	
::: fragment
Explanations:

- [Gavras et al. 2022]{style="color:blue"}: Audio formats facilitate the answer process by enabling open narration, intuitive and spontaneous answers (‚â† intentional and conscious text answers).

- [Revilla et al. 2020]{style="color:blue"}: Speaking requires less effort than typing and voice formats make survey answering easier and quicker.
:::

::: fragment
- Unfortunately, spoken answers compared to written answers increase response times and non-response rates [(Revilla et al. 2020, L√ºtters et al. 2018)]{style="color:blue"}
:::

</font size>





------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methods for the Analysis of Audio Data

::: header
Audio Data in the Social Sciences and in Surveys
:::

<font size = "6">

- Increasing number of methods to analyze audio data

- Intersection of Computer Science, Computational Linguistics and Computational Social Science
	
::: fragment
- Examples of Methods:

	- Automatic Speech Recognition ("speech-to-text")
		
	- Natural Language Processing
		
	- Speaker Diarization / Speaker Identification
	
	- Environmental Sound Analysis
		
	- <u>Speech Emotion Recognition</u>
:::

</font size>


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <font size = "14">Emotion Analysis</font size> {.center}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Speech Emotion Recognition

::: header
Emotion Analysis
:::

<font size = "6">

- Why use Speech for Emotion Analysis? ‚Üí Recognizing emotions from text is difficult because it is stripped of all paralinguistic and acoustic features

::: fragment
- Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is part of the field of Automated Emotion Recognition, further intersecting with disciplines such as Neurocomputing and Affective Computing 
:::

::: fragment
- Evolution of Models from traditional Machine Learning models (e.g., logistic regression) to deep learning based methods, e.g. SpeechBrain (Ravanelli et al. 2021)
:::

</font size>


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Emotion Recognition = Sentiment Analysis?

::: header
Emotion Analysis
:::

<font size = "6">

<blockquote>The concept of emotions is not always clearly distinguished from similar phenomena such as mood, affect, and feeling. (Gabriel et al. 2023, 39)</blockquote>


::: fragment
- [Sentiment]{style="color:blue"}: the valence of a feeling (e.g., positive versus negative)

- [Emotions]{style="color:blue"}: a more complex and multi-dimensional state of feeling further characterized by their intensity as well as their cognitive evaluations (e.g., other-person control for anger) 

- [Affect]{style="color:blue"} = "an umbrella term that is used to refer to both emotions and moods" (Lee, Dirks, and Campagna 2023, 549)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

::: header
Emotions in Political Trust
:::

<font size = "6">

- Conventional notion of political trust where trust judgments are made upon the basis of risk calculations and rational choice-making processes

::: fragment
- Recently challenged by the idea of an "affect-based" form of political trust (e.g., Theiss-Morse and Barton 2017)

<blockquote>"A decision to trust a government organization may [‚Ä¶] not always be
conscious and/or rational.‚Äù (Grimmelikhuijsen 2012, 57)</blockquote>

- ‚ÄúAutomatic Hot Cognition‚Äù (Lodge and Taber 2013)
:::

</font size>


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions and Motivation

::: header
Emotions in Political Trust
:::

<font size = "6">

<blockquote>[What thought processes and associations come to respondents' minds when prompted to discuss 'politics' and their level of trust?]{style="color:black"}</blockquote>

::: fragment
<blockquote>[Are individual trust judgments in surveys driven by affective  components?]{style="color:black"}</blockquote>
:::

::: fragment
Motivation:

1. Research on determinants of political trust generates knowledge on [how trust evolves and changes over time]{style="color:blue"}.

2. The influence of emotions on political trust is crucial in order to [understand how the media such as television uses emotions as an instrument for influencing people]{style="color:blue"}, for example by showing politicians‚Äôs emotional appearances in the media (Gabriel et al. 2023)

## Discussion

::: header
Emotions in Political Trust
:::

<font size = "6">

- We find that individual's associations, thought processes and feelings influence how much they report to have trust in politics.

- But we find few respondents to use emotional language in their answers and there is no consistent effect of emotions on reported trust score.

::: fragment
Two follow-up questions:

- Maybe a survey setting is a too formal setting top elicit emotions? 
	- Could depend on circumstances, e.g. are others around?
:::

::: fragment
- How does SpeechBrain classify? Can we generate a human benchmark?
:::

<!-- speechbrain has not been used in social science research so far and we need more applications with other survey datasets -->

</font size>


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## <font size = "14"> How could future research on voice and emotions look like?  </font size> {.center}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Outlook on future research agenda

::: header
Outlook
:::

<font size = "6">

- Overall, audio data plays a crucial role for studying societies, as spoken language is one of humanity's most important means of communication, expression and information exchange in various fields (e.g., public speeches and debates, political talk shows and podcasts, press conferences).

- ‚Üí We need more applied research to gain more experiences with this type of data.

::: fragment
- Subfields to research: speech-to-text algorithms (Landesvatter, Behnert, Bauer 2023, Meitinger, Sluis, Schonlau 2024), ethical considerations and privacy concerns, survey and experiments design to collect audio data, etc.
:::

::: fragment
- Multi-disciplinary approaches are useful (e.g., experts from linguistics, sociology, psychology, and computer science).
:::

<!-- Examination of ethical considerations and privacy concerns surrounding the collection and use of audio data in research. -->
