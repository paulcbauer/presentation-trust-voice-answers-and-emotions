3," They are very shady, power hungry monsters and the worst of the human race.",['neu'],negative,negative
2," The federal government, like all the other governments on this planet, is corrupt and it will never have your best interest in mind. Politicians are corrupt evil people.",['neu'],negative,negative
5," I think we can trust them to do what's right most of the time because at the end of the day even after a lot of fighting and arguing back and forth, the things that need to get done generally get done.",['neu'],positive,positive
3, Because I think that there are a lot of problems in this country that most people in government positions don't really care about too much.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," Because I don't like Republicans, all they do is try to bog legislation down. It's not good.",['neu'],negative,negative
4, I think there's a lot of cover-ups and there's a lot of conspiracy theories and I don't always believe in those but some of them I do believe to be true. Like I don't believe that we walked on the moon and I believe that we knew about 9-11 before it happened.,['sad'],neutral,negative
3," I chose some of the time because I think most of the politicians in our federal government are not trustworthy. I do believe, though, in critical times, the Constitution will be followed.",['neu'],negative,neutral
5, I feel that most people who work in the government are trying to do their best to do what's best for the majority of the people.,['ang'],neutral,positive
3, I just think that there are too many crooked politicians just like everybody. There's crooked politicians and people who have their own interests at heart and not everybody else's.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, some of the time because I said so.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, I answer some of the time because I believe most politicians work for their own interest and their own private greed and not for the people that elected them.,['neu'],negative,negative
4," It wildly depends on the subject matter and who ends up on the committee, let alone who is paying for them. There are simply too many variables to say anything but half the time, since it's a total toss-up.",['neu'],negative,neutral
5, Because I trust President Biden. I think our values are aligned and we agree on the important aspects of both domestic and foreign policy.,['ang'],positive,positive
3," I don't have too much trust in the government these days. I think there's too much money involved in influencing politicians and laws. So I should have said never, but sometimes maybe.",['sad'],negative,negative
3," It has been my experience over the decades that they can be trusted sometimes, but not all that often.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
2," Everybody that's in Washington have been there for years and years and years and are getting paid by lobbyists to do what the lobbyists want them to do, not what is for the greater good of the United States.",['neu'],negative,negative
4," It takes three months before La Haina is fully reopened. Well, I know that we were working in an office that had been open for almost 50 years. And they selected our office to be shut, to be terminated. The entire office was shut down, and I don't believe that was necessary.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," While most of the time, like, politicians in Washington just seem to like, you know, pass bills and do things to benefit wealthy people, sometimes they do, like, pass more progressive or like helpful for the general public, like in terms of policies.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, It seems that we are always embroiled in some type of government issue. So I sincerely doubt that they are that up front with everything that they're supposed to be doing.,['neu'],negative,negative
5," The current administration, I trust the current administration, which is basically making a lot of the decisions. So I'd say most of the time I trust what's going on.",['hap'],positive,positive
5," Yeah, most of the time they do things that are correct. Every once in a while you get something that seems a little bit corrupt, a little bit self-serving, but for the majority of it I can kind of see why they made certain decisions even though I might not agree with them.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
4," Occasionally politicians are acting in good faith, but about half the time they serve special interests and lobbyists instead of what the people really want.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," I answer some of the time because it depends on who's in power. Basically, the Republicans cannot be trusted. They don't want what's best for their constituents. They want what's best for them. So if the Democrats are in charge, then there's a lot better chance of things being reasonable, but if not, all bets are off.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," Some of the time, what is good or right for all of the people also involves them. Most of the time, it does not involve them, so they don't do what is good or right for the people.",['neu'],neutral,negative
3, I just don't fully trust the government to do the right things in a lot of cases.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, I'm not happy with the liberal current administration and I think they focus too much on illegal immigrants and harm the economy and current residential national interests.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," I said some of the time because it depends on who is in power in the federal government. I have more trust in some people than others. I don't necessarily trust either party as a whole to do their jobs and do what is right, but there are people that I trust more than others to do that.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3," Roe v. Wade overturned. President falling asleep. President not knowing what day it is. President taking whatever is being whispered to him. President walking out in the middle of the ceremony. I sure didn't vote for him, but a lot of people did, and it's just chaotic with politics in general.",['neu'],negative,negative
2, Government exists only to perpetuate itself. It does so by promulgating rules and raising taxes in order to keep control of the populace.,['ang'],negative,negative
4," I feel like it depends on who is in power in every branch, including who's in power for the president and then who is in power in the Congress and depending on what party and what I feel is right, that kind of determines on how I feel about what happened. So about half the time.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
2, I think their motives are driven by power and money and I don't think they truly care about our well-being.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, It seems like sometimes I just don't trust those that are in power to be able to do the right thing for the common man and that they have so many different special interest groups and they're beholding to others.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," Because it depends on who's in power. Every time we get a Republican president, they undo everything that the Democrats did. They get rid of, you know, safety laws, things like that, and then we end up in a worse spot than we did.",['neu'],negative,negative
5," Again, Congress does what's best for the public. It's only fringe issues that make the news. Most of the stuff goes to them. Most people don't pay attention to it.",['neu'],neutral,positive
2," I don't really trust the government because of widespread surveillance of the Patriot Act. Like, they've shown numerous times that they're willing to break their own rules in order to arrest people. Like, it's just... it's not a good time.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," It really depends who's in control of the federal government as to whether you can trust her or not. Somebody like President Trump you cannot trust, but somebody like President Biden you could.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, It really depends on who is in office and I think the federal government is so diverse with so many different people and so many different departments that you can't just generalize overall. So I'm just trying to pick the best answer that I can.,['ang'],neutral,neutral
3," I say I trust the government some of the time because although I trust the president and the Democrats, I do not trust anything the Republicans do.",['ang'],neutral,negative
3," I don't know, I just feel like sometimes they do the right thing, sometimes they don't. Because they need to compromise different opinions and think about the whole picture. So my personal preference may not always align with what they did to us to do.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
4," Because I feel like sometimes, I feel like they're doing the best they can, but when you have Republicans and Democrats fighting against one another, it makes it tough at times.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, because they often make mistakes and I don't have a high level of trust for them.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," The government asks for a lot of things. They say they'll give you, but then they don't give you anything.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," I believe that the government is only out for money for themselves, the individuals, and that they only vote on things that are good for the country when they can put money in their pockets.",['neu'],negative,negative
3, I chose some of the time as my answer for the previous question because I feel like only some of the time can you actually trust the federal government in Washington. A large part of the time they do not keep their word.,['neu'],negative,negative
4," I think that there are some politicians that do the job for the benefit of the people, and some of them that do it for their own self-interests.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
4," I'm isolated half the time because politics is politics and some do their best and some don't want to do anything at all. So the odds of getting everything done, it's impossible and the odds of nothing getting done is impossible because they will lose their job. So the best bet for me would be 50% to get stuff done and the other 50% don't get anything done.",['neu'],negative,neutral
5," I believe that most of the time the people in the government, at least in the executive parts of it, are trying to do the right thing.",['neu'],positive,positive
3, I just feel a lot of politicians are untrustworthy and they just want what benefits them.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, I feel that the majority of politicians in government are too beholden to special interests and honestly keep them and they're more concerned with holding on to power than they are representing their constituents.,['neu'],negative,negative
2," The federal government has been trustworthy in the now approaching decades. They're extremely untrustworthy, even if you think they're doing the right thing. It's often probably an ulterior agenda, so that's the reason why at this point there's no reason to trust them.",['neu'],negative,negative
4, I said about half the time because it seems like a lot of the time they don't even know what they're doing. Neither side can agree with the other one and they end up making more mess than they solve during their terms.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," The government has proven time and time again that they don't always have the public interests at heart. They are motivated by lobbyists and money and their own selfish desires much of the time. So no, I often don't trust them.",['neu'],negative,negative
4," I trust the government sometimes, but I think there are some bad eggs in Washington. And I think there are some people who maybe have their own agenda or aren't exactly making the best choices for all of the American people to keep America safe. So I said about half of the time because I also believe that there are good people in the world who will make good choices. But this is kind of a tricky question because I trust some of what the federal government does, but I'm just not sure for the future.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
2," No matter what, in Washington, there is going to be somebody that is working for somebody else to get something that they want that does not benefit anybody. And even when they do good things, there's always bad things intertwined with it to make somebody else happy.",['ang'],negative,negative
3," I would like to believe that even a broken clock is right twice a day, and sometimes for the wrong reasons, Washington can do the right thing. Albeit once in a blue moon.",['neu'],positive,neutral
4, Eight or ten years ago I would have given a very different answer and said that I trusted them almost all of the time. There's been so much turmoil and dysfunction and I was optimistic to say about half of the time. I just don't know. It totally depends on the issue and who's making the decisions.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3," I selected some of the time because I think that usually the federal government, if there's an emergency, will do what I would consider is the right thing. But a lot of other times their interest is not necessarily in line with what the majority of the people would benefit from, but more on politicians and individuals advancing something that they want or need for themselves.",['sad'],neutral,neutral
2, you,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, I said some of the time because it just really depends on each politician and their place in the political spectrum and it really depends on a lot of things. So sometimes I do trust them sometimes I don't. It really depends on the politician.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, I believe that the federal government makes a lot of decisions and takes a lot of actions that the public never find out about.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, I chose some of the time because there's no option for almost never Because usually they take their own interest lobbying interest or The interest of companies instead of the public and they're only care what do we think?,['neu'],neutral,negative
3, There are very few people that I trust to do what is right all the time and I especially don't trust somebody I don't know to do what is right when I don't know them well enough.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," Because you can never really trust anyone, let alone the government, to do what they say they're going to do or do anything that's right.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," The federal government sometimes just seems to want to do whatever's best for them and not necessarily what's best for the people, but sometimes it does seem like there are people that really care, so I'm 50-50 on trusting them.",['neu'],negative,neutral
4, Because they don't always do what the people want. They do what they want. They don't think about people like us in government.,['neu'],negative,negative
2," Because it's pretty common knowledge that lobbyists give money to politicians who are greedy, and so they do what's in their own best interest.",['neu'],negative,negative
2, I don't feel like you can ever trust the federal government in Washington to do what is right. They do what's best for them and what makes them money. They don't truly care about what's right for the people.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, Whichever.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
2, I feel like the government can't be trusted because their interests are not aligned with the common people's and they're acting from a place of greed and self-interest.,['neu'],negative,negative
4, I don't trust politicians.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," Simply the stacking of the Supreme Court, the votes to not certify the election. There have been many instances in which the federal government cannot be trusted to do what's right.",['neu'],negative,negative
4, I would say that sometimes they're more driven by money than it is to protect their citizens.,['neu'],negative,negative
4," I think most politicians try to do the right thing, but they fight amongst each other and they get nothing done.",['neu'],negative,neutral
3," Um, I don't like how the Congress has been voting on certain things, and I just don't trust the government being run by, um, conservatives. So that's why I don't trust them.",['neu'],negative,negative
3, I just have a hard time trusting our government. I feel like there's just so many secrets and so many things that we the American people have no idea is going on.,['sad'],negative,negative
5," I don't always think the federal government does what is in the public's best interest, but most of the time they do, but not all of the time.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3," I selected some of the time because as we are finding out, there are organizations and people within our government who are corrupt and who are not honest.",['neu'],negative,negative
4, because they don't always tell the truth and sometimes they withhold information and they don't always meet their promises due to budget and economic concerns.,['neu'],negative,negative
2, I can't remember a time other than maybe World War II that the government didn't lie to us.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," Congress gets in the way of doing what's right for the country when they practice bipartisan politics. So, when that's taken off the table, then they do usually get it right.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3," I selected some of the time because there are very, there are a few laws and acts that get passed that actually do help people. But you know, most of the time the laws and everything that's going to affect somehow seem to benefit the upper class and the rich and the wealthy instead of focusing more on the working class and the low class, which I think Phil gets neglected and set aside.",['neu'],negative,negative
2," I have zero faith in the federal government that they're ever going to do you know what is right for the people. With our interest in mind, the only interest in mind that they have is you know corporations, who they're you know the lobbyists and people like that. It's never the normal everyday person.",['hap'],negative,negative
4," Well, half the time because they're rational people, but they have motives that aren't always going to line up with approximately half the population.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3," The reason I selected some of the time is because, as shown in recent years, the government basically only looks out for themselves or the rich. They don't look out for the entirety of this nation.",['neu'],negative,negative
2," I just feel like, especially lately, the government isn't really listening to what we, the people, want. And they're kind of making a lot of decisions that, like, go against our wishes and our well-being. And, yeah, I just feel like there's been a lot of legislations and stuff like that passed that kind of seems like it sets us back as a country. And it seems like we were regressing. So yeah, I just don't really trust that they do the right thing, especially these days.",['sad'],negative,negative
2," Because politicians in Washington only look after their own best interests, not the best interests of their people, their constituents, or anything else. They're only confident in doing things that benefit them as a whole.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," I think that the federal government in Washington is generally not to be trusted to do what is right, but every now and then whenever it benefits those people that also would happen to benefit the American people, then that's whenever, you know, some of the time they do what's right, but only if it's to their own benefit.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," Politicians spend too much time worrying about poll numbers and getting re-elected, and they do following the will of people.",['neu'],neutral,negative
2, I selected never because it seems like our federal government is interested only in their own personal gain. They're not really interested in what the people of America want.,['neu'],negative,negative
4," I think because in regards to the federal government, there's a lot of things that they can't do. So, like during COVID, there are things that we want the federal government to take the reins on, but due to partisanship, there's things that prevent the government from working as it probably should. So I don't believe that they always do what is right. There's many times where we're disappointed as a society because they're not doing what they're supposed to.",['sad'],negative,negative
2," The government is run primarily in the interests of wealthy people and large corporations, so I can't trust it to do what's right for the people.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," Often it seems like what happens in Washington is just for people in big cities like in New York City or Los Angeles. They don't really affect what people in the rural, less populated states need. Kind of feel like we're left behind.",['hap'],negative,negative
3, Cause I don't think that they have earnerships in hands. I think everybody just cares about the rich and what it can get from them. Not the middle class. They care about the poor people or the rich people but not the middle class. Therefore I don't trust them for all.,['neu'],negative,negative
5," Most of the time is when Democrats are in charge, not Republicans.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
4, It is a system of checks and balances and it is a two-party system. So that equals out to about half the time they're going to do the right thing.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
5, Most of the time I trust the federal government to do the right thing and sometimes I really don't. That is how I feel about it.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3," of the time, because I think that most people who make decisions for others are putting their interests first, their own interests.",['neu'],neutral,negative
4," I am a Democrat. I think the Democratic Congress does a great job. I think a Democratic president like Biden does a good job. I think the Republicans are in utter chaos, so about half the time.",['neu'],positive,neutral
3," I think the federal government is more out for their own interests and I think the decisions that they make are in ordinance with that, not necessarily what's right for the American people. They do what's right for all the big corporations and lobbyists and such that basically are funding their campaign.",['neu'],neutral,negative
5," I selected most of the time because I generally believe in government. That it does good things for the people. It provides public education, builds roads and bridges, provides Social Security, and helps with research and development. All the things that government does I think generally are positive.",['neu'],positive,positive
4, I think it depends because sometimes there are aspects where I agree with the politicians' choices but other times I don't agree with them.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, I selected some of the time because I really don't trust the government because of past things that have happened. I just feel like there's a lot of things that are being hidden from the public.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, Because some of the time they do what is right and some of the times they don't. That's just the way I feel.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
4," They seem to be well-meaning in a lot of things. However, they just can't get a lot of things done due to division between the different parties.",['neu'],negative,neutral
3," I think you can only trust the government, federal government, to do what is right. Sometimes, because a lot of times they don't do what's right for the people. They always have the agenda.",['neu'],neutral,negative
3," That's kind of a hard question, but I feel like there's not always a black and white line of what's right and what's wrong.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
2," They never work, they hardly ever work for the people. When we want something, we need something, they give it to other countries besides the American people. Just like stimulus, they give all the stimulus money to other countries and barely gave anything to the Americans.",['sad'],negative,negative
3, I believe people in federal government do what's in their own best interests and only occasionally does that align with what we the people need. There's kind of a disconnect. And that's why I picked that answer.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
5, The government tends to do a lot of sketchy things that I'm very worried about.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, It is very hard for the left and the right to come together to make decisions that affect our lives. That is why I only trust the government some of the time.,['ang'],negative,neutral
4," Because there are still people at the end of the day, and people with power cannot be 100% trusted. So they're still going to make decisions that are beneficial to them and their race and their tax brackets and all that.",['hap'],neutral,negative
3," The federal government has been known to deceive people, keep secrets from people, not tell the public the whole truth or anything like the truth several times in the past.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," The federal government in Washington will sometimes do what's right, but mainly do what's in the best interest for themselves. That's why I chose sometimes.",['neu'],neutral,negative
2," I think the federal government in Washington is more concerned about money and especially money for themselves. Everybody in politics and in Congress, I don't think they care for the nation as a whole as long as they are getting paid. That's the bottom line for them.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," It's truly hard to trust politicians and people in the government to be 100% honest and do what they need to do. It feels like it's, they're money hungry or power hungry and it's not really about the people and what the people need.",['neu'],negative,negative
4, Let's go!,['neu'],positive,neutral
3," I think that the government as a whole wants to do the right thing, but there are corrupt people running things that will not allow the right thing to be done.",['neu'],negative,neutral
2," The government has gotten way more corrupt than it ever has been, and I don't trust any decisions they make because they don't look out for the American people.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," And so, that's the thing that I'm up to is about the country.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, Some things the federal government does is right for some people. Some things the federal government does is not right for some people. It just depends on the situation. Blatant lying like they do isn't right for anybody.,['neu'],negative,neutral
3," You can't always trust the government because they're only a certain type of people, they don't include everyone, and they don't live the lives that we do, so they only can think, do what they think is right, not what is right.",['sad'],negative,negative
3, I think the federal government usually acts in their own best interests and for those that have a lot of money and that is not the majority of the general public.,['neu'],neutral,negative
2," I'd say 99% of the people working in Washington DC have been paid off by corporations or other special interests. They're not working for the interest of the people anymore, although that was the normal intent of our government.",['neu'],negative,negative
4, I think you can trust the government about half the time because I think while they try to do the best sometimes they hide things from us and Other times they say that they're going to do things but they're never able to live up to their promises So that's why I chose about half the time,['neu'],negative,neutral
3," Regardless of political ideology, I don't really trust politicians, especially in DC, to actually have kind of the best interest in mind when they're making decisions. It's all about them and their friends, their family, not necessarily the average American.",['neu'],negative,negative
3, Because I feel like politicians are very self-serving and only work in the best interests of themselves and the people who donate to their campaigns. I think they rarely do anything for the greater good of all of us.,['neu'],negative,negative
3, I believe you can only trust the federal government some of the time because Democrats in office are lying about everything from the war in Ukraine to COVID where Republicans normally tell the truth.,['neu'],negative,neutral
3," When the people in power are beholden to the interests of the people with money and not to the actual concerns of people, then it becomes really difficult to trust their decisions because they're bought and paid for. They don't do things because it would benefit anyone. They do things because it benefits the people who pay them.",['neu'],negative,negative
3, Everything is lies and manipulation of what they want us to know.,['hap'],negative,negative
3," I do not think they do that much, but I also don't think they do nothing.",['ang'],neutral,neutral
5, I've answered this question about four times now and I'll answer it again. I can trust the federal government because of them being the elected officials and their integrity should be very high.,['neu'],positive,positive
3, I think most politicians are corrupt. Most elected politicians are corrupt. But there are a lot of good people who are bureaucrats who are just trying to do the right thing. And so that's why some of the time you can trust that the government in Washington will do the right thing.,['neu'],positive,neutral
3, I feel like you can only trust the federal government in Washington to do what is right some of the time because a lot of the time the politicians are out for themselves and what they can gain from certain situations.,['neu'],neutral,negative
5," I feel like the government is actually trustworthy in some ways, that's actually trying to understand what the people are saying to them, what needs to be fixed and what can be done.",['neu'],neutral,positive
3," I'm not sure, I guess you can trust them on some things, some things you can't. I just go mostly by what I hear.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
4, I don't think they often do the right thing.,['hap'],negative,negative
3," I already did a recording on this, but I'm going to repeat it. I think our federal government in Washington only does what's right some of the time, and the time that they're doing what is right is when they're voting their own conscience and not simply voting what their constituents are going to want it to be.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
2," I have absolutely no faith in Washington right now. It's just a fight between the Democrats and the Republicans and bills don't get passed. And it's just a pissing match, honestly. I have absolutely no trust in our federal government to do the right thing for its people.",['neu'],negative,negative
4, I feel it would be giving them too much credit to go beyond 50% of saying that they get things right about half the time.,['ang'],neutral,negative
4," I answered about half the time because I feel like oftentimes there are certain factions, especially on the right, especially from Republicans that only do what is best for them, basically. Essentially, they only care about their party and nothing else, and they only care about staying in power.",['neu'],negative,negative
3," Occasionally, they might make a good decision on accident.",['neu'],neutral,negative
3, I feel like they're not trustworthy and that they're somewhat lacking in morals.,['neu'],negative,negative
4," If the Democrats are in power, then I would trust the government a lot more. But if the other party is in power, I don't trust them as far as I can throw them.",['neu'],negative,negative
3, Thank you.,['neu'],positive,positive
4," American politicians seem very disconnected from the constituents, so they do make good decisions, but they also make very bad decisions that affect us.",['neu'],negative,neutral
3, I think most of the time they don't get things right and they misspend money towards the military and things we don't need and bank bailouts but some of the time they do get things right just not very often.,['neu'],negative,negative
2, I feel you cannot trust the government in Washington because of the fact that the government is no longer for the people by the people. The government is for itself and for the rich.,['ang'],negative,negative
2, I feel like I don't trust it and I never will because I feel like there's a lot of homeless people in America and I feel like they help other countries but they don't help their own country to do better.,['neu'],negative,negative
3," I chose some of the time because sometimes choices that they make are in everyone's interest, in which case they can be trusted. But when there are conflicting interests within the people working in Washington, I cannot trust them to do what is right.",['neu'],negative,neutral
4," I feel that while a lot of times the US government will do what is right, the politicians have many self-interests that work their thinking because they do not want to hurt their interests.",['neu'],neutral,negative
4," I said about half the time because I trust Democrats to do what's right, but don't trust Republicans, so it balances out to about half the time.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
4," I would trust the federal government for, well, about half the time. Most of the time they would make the correct decisions for the nation, but some of the decisions I may or may not agree with.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
5," I think that people on the whole, including people in the government, generally want to do what's right.",['neu'],positive,positive
5, Most of the time you can trust them because most of them are good people. The people you can't trust are the current Republican idiots in Congress who are fucking things up for our whole country.,['neu'],negative,negative

4," A lot of politicians today are just in it for themselves, for power or greed or money, not necessarily for the people.",['neu'],negative,negative
3, Because I really don't see the government having my particular interests and mine just kind of their own. And really just kind of disregarding anybody else's opinion or anybody else's thoughts on what should be done.,['neu'],negative,negative

5, Sometimes I've been hearing mixed results of political incentives and there'd be a lot of delays.,['neu'],negative,neutral
5," I selected most of the time because I feel like I don't think the government is completely against us and I think that most people try to do the right thing, but the right thing isn't always the right thing for everyone and that's why a lot of people have problems with the government because we're all different.",['ang'],neutral,neutral
5, I selected most of the time because usually for majority of it we can trust that the government will do what's right for us but some of the times we don't always agree and we don't. We don't.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, Because I don't think they have the people's best interests. I think the government mostly looks out for themselves and there's a lot of moving parts in it. And I don't think it always works correctly the way it should.,['neu'],negative,negative
2," There are several reasons as to why I can't really trust the federal government to do what's right. And that's because, just look at the results. They've done nothing right.

3," The federal government right now is made up of so many diverse people that are only out for themselves. They're not really thinking of the people that they represent.

2," Because everybody in the government is corrupt, especially the Democrats. Look how they're going after Donald Trump. It's blatant election interference.

3," I rarely trust them to do what's right, but not because I'm a right-wing crazy fanatic, but because I'm on the left, and I don't think they have the best interests of the American people in mind. I think they're bought off by lobbyists. I think that's particularly true of the right-wing, who are opportunists and have their own political futures at heart. I don't think the Democrats are much better. I think we live in a capitalist society, and under capitalism, it's profit which drives everything.

4," I would say for the most part our government has our best interests in mind, but they also have their own agenda that they would probably not make compromise over.",['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, A lot of people in Washington are only worried about themselves and appearing with their constituents. So they can be re-elected and they don't actually do things with any morals or ethics or regard for human life.

4, This question is very broad so it was difficult to answer because it could pertain to many aspects of the federal government and also many individuals. There are certain individuals that I would trust more than others. That's why I gave the answer about half of the time because it's such a broad encompassing question.,['neu'],neutral,neutral
3, I selected some of the time for how often you can trust the federal government in Washington because I believe that politicians are out for their own self-interest rather than the good of the people. And that is very clear after the last few elections and what is currently happening within the federal government that it's all about political games rather than the good of the people.,['neu'],negative,negative

And you know, the government can't always respond to every single demographic and make sure they have exactly what they need, and they aren't even really interested in doing that a lot of the time. So yeah, to say the government can do the right thing at all is difficult. And sometimes the government does right by the most vulnerable people in the society. It's not very often, but it occasionally happens. Most of the time, it's doing right by the biggest, loudest majorities of the population, which is doing wrong by everyone else. So from my perspective, that's a net wrong from people in that majority. It's a net right. So...",['neu'],neutral,negative

2, Because politicians are always crooked and out to steal every penny you have.,['neu'],negative,negative
4, So I don't think the government is inherently bad or good. I would say they do the right thing about half the time. I feel like certain politicians have very good motivations and really try to do what's right for the people. But there are just so many special interests and lobbies that really carry a lot of weight that I think it's hard for them to always triumph over that. So I would say they do the right thing about half the time.,['neu'],neutral,neutral

5, I say most of the time because I mean I guess right now Democrats are in charge so I trust them to handle the affairs of our country generally. Majority of the time Republicans I don't trust them at all so I mean I think most of the time Democrats would do what's right.,['neu'],neutral,neutral

3, I mean politicians tend to be like really corrupt and have all the lobbyists in mind rather than the people's interests in mind.
